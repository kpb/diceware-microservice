## Yet Another Diceware Passphrase Generator

with microservices!

This project is an exercise in microservice development, but can be used to create secure passphrases.

### Diceware?

[Diceware][1] is a simple way of creating strong and easy to remember passphrases. A new passphrase is
generated by rolling a die and creating a series of five digit numbers which are then used to look up words
from a [Diceware word list][2]. The result is a somewhat easy to remember passphrase that is very easy to
remember. e.g., _cleft cam synod lacy canal wok_.

The [Diceware homepage][1] describes the method and includes some theory behind it, such as how many bits of
entropy the passphrases have and tons of other info.

The Diceware method encourages you to use a physical die. However, the [faq][3] states that you can use a
_good_ random number generator to create passphrases, such as Java's `SecureRandom` Class.

The Intercept published a nice article on how to use Diceware [here][5], which also includes some theory about
how strong the passphrases are.

### Design

TODO Microservices. Spring boot. Spring Netflix OSS. Other goodness.

### Building and Running

You'll need a recent version of [Maven][4]

    $ mvn --version

Clone the project

    $ git clone https://github.com/kpb/diceware-microservice.git
    
Build from the top

    $ cd diceware-microservice
    $ mvn clean install

#### CLI

Run the command line app and follow the instructions. _Note the version of the jar may change_

    $ java -jar diceware-cli/target/diceware-cli-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar 
    Welcome to Diceware CLI!
