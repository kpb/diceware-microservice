# 2. Use a Successful Git Branching Model

Date: 2018-12-07

## Status

~~Accepted~~ Superseded by [0003-use-github-flow.md](0003-use-github-flow.md)

## Context

The project needs a Git branching model that will support releases, release patching, and ongoing
development. It should be simple, idiomatic, and be publicly documented. We shouldn't re-invent the wheel, nor should we
[bike shed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality) edge cases that are high in complexity, low in value.

## Decision

We will use the popular [A Successful Git Branching Model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

## Consequences

We will be able to more easily support releases AND development. The method is popular, well documented, and has a
history of success.

It is more complicated than what we are currently doing, which is nothing.
